## UMass-Campus-Navigator ##

UMass Campus Navigator is a web-based application designed to help newcomers to the University of Massachusetts Amherst navigate the campus efficiently. By uploading (or manually inputting) their weekly class schedule, students can generate an optimized walking route from their dormitory to all of their classes for a given day. The system focuses on providing clear, efficient paths to help students learn the campus layout, minimize walking time between classes, and reduce the stress of finding their way in a new environment.
